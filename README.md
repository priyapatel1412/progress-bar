# Progress Bar

This project is a progress bar.

## Description

This project serves as a progress bar.The progress bar project aims to implement a solution for managing multiple bars and controlling their progress using a set of controls. It includes dependencies, development dependencies, and scripts for running, testing, and linting the code.

## Node.js Version Requirement

This project requires Node.js version 14.0.0 or later version. Please make sure you have Node.js installed on your system before proceeding.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

#### Testing

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries for testing:

- Jest: A powerful and flexible JavaScript testing framework that provides a test runner, assertion utilities, and mocking capabilities.
- React Testing Library: A lightweight and intuitive library for testing React components. It encourages testing components from the user's perspective, focusing on their behavior rather than implementation details.
- @testing-library/jest-dom: A custom set of matchers for Jest that enables you to make assertions about the state of the DOM elements.
- @testing-library/user-event: A library for simulating user events such as typing, clicking, and more. It provides a convenient API to interact with your components during tests.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run lint`

Runs ESLint to perform linting checks on the project's source code.
It analyzes the JavaScript files in the src directory and reports any linting errors or warnings based on the ESLint configuration.

Make sure you have installed the required dependencies, including ESLint and its plugins, before running this command.

Linting helps enforce code quality and maintain consistent code style. It catches potential issues and enforces best practices.
